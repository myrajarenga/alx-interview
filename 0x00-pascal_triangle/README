Task 
0. Pascal's Triangle
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer
we first check if n is less than or equal to 0. If so, we return an empty list since Pascal's triangle cannot be generated for non-positive values of n.

If n is greater than 0, we initialize triangle as a list containing the first row of Pascal's triangle, which is [1].

We then iterate from 1 to n-1 to generate each subsequent row of the triangle. Inside this loop, we initialize an empty list row and obtain the previous row from triangle.

Within the nested loop, we calculate the values of each element in the row by summing the corresponding elements from the previous row.

After completing the nested loop, we add 1 to the end of the row and append the row to triangle.

Finally, we return the complete triangle representing Pascal's triangle.
